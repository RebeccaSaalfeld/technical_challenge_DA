I created a Tableau Dashboard. Here is a link:

My results so far are:
- Both E10 and SP98 seem to be the same over all regarding consume/distance and consume/speed, so your company can change to E10 if you want to.
- But for example with low average speed(below 20 km/h ) as well as around 40 km/h the consumption of E10 is higher
- cosumption of SP98 is highest between 20-25 km/h

With more time I would further investigate:
- the influence of the weather
- Which are the most used average speed?
- How speed and distance are related to each other and to the consume together
